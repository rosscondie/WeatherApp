# WeatherApp - React Native 

This application was built using JavaScript with React Native fetching data from the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

I wanted to see how mobile applications were made and to learn more about using React Native.

## Learning Outcomes:

- I learned how to use [expo.dev](https://expo.dev/) to run the application on my device.
- How to use a simulator for iOS and Android devices on my local computer.
- Using async await functions to fetch data from the API.
- I expanded my learning on how to configure state for conditional rendering.
- How to make custom hooks within React.
- About multiple screen navigation on mobile devices.
- Using inline styles within jsx.
- StyleSheets within React Native.
